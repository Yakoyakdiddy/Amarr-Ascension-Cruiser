# Amarr-Ascension-Cruiser

This is a 3D interpretation of a design I submitted for the EVE Online Design a Starship competition back in 2010.
This is the first project in which I have taken a design that is entirely my own (as opposed to using a tutorial and interpreting it with individual customisations), albeit I have used pre-existing textures to accuaretly emulate 'ingame' Amarr materials.
I also took the opportunity to create a World background of  a nebula, which are the iconic and recognisable backgrounds of EVE Online.
